**MinimalSaaS Project Manifesto**

The goal of the MinimalSaaS project is to create an end-to-end "Hello World". That is, there are dozens of candidate technologies out there. There are Javascript frameworks like Ember.js, Anuglar.js, Backbone, and jQuery. There are back-end technologies like J2EE, Node.js, and Spring/MVC. There are bunches of different cloud/scalable database technologies. There are also DevOps tools like Jenkins, Puppet, Chef, et al. There are different cloud providers like AWS, Azure, OpenStack, and plain old LAMP image providers like GoDaddy and HostGator. Each one of these things has some sort of tutorial and/or "Hello World" demo, but these tutorial examples are all isolated - there is no overall working system "Hello World" that shows how all the pieces snap together in a very clean, minimal, easy-to-understand implementation. 

The goal of this project is to create an idiot-simple SaaS application that works (without billing) and can be taken apart and put back together again swapping out different technology pieces to get an idea of how they fit together and compare with each other. 

Note: other than implementing RESTful APIs between the pieces, MinimalSaaS will NOT jump through hoops to demonstrated sophisticated patterns, dependency injection, object-oriented analysis, security, software internationalization, accessibility, error logging, application management, unit testing technologies, clever algorithms and other so on. The goal is for each piece to be really, really easy to understand. Once you start slathering on all these enterprise-level robustness concerns the code will invariably get very hard to understand â€“ no matter which technologies you use. My thought is that once I have a reasonable set of MinimalSaaS  components working and stable I will then create one or more forks of NotSoMinimalSaaS projects to demonstrate how these robustness techniques get added to the easy-to-understand base.

My plan is to plug away and put these little pieces in place one-by-one over the next few months. However, if you would like to help/collaborate, please feel free to contact me at djhreg@yahoo.com
